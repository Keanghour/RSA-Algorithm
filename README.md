# RSA-Algorithm
The RSA algorithm is a public-key cryptosystem for secure data transmission. Developed by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman in 1977, it uses two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. RSA ensures secure communication by allowing only the recipient to decrypt the message
